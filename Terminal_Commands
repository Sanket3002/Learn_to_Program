#touch NAME.FILETYPE -- make a file with a filetype
#rm FILE -- remove a file
#rmdir DIRECTORY -- remove an empty folder
#rm -r -f DIRECTORY -- force remove a folder recursively (aka remove a folder with stuff)
#nano FILE -- basic terminal-based text editor, use ^x (control x), then hit y or n to confirm, and enter to save
#sudo COMMAND -- use a command with all privelges
#git clone GITHUBURL -- clone a repository (folder) from github
