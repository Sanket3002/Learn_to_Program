#New project: combing what you know about functions and arrays, make a function that will swap two elements in an array

swapMe = [1,6,3,4,5,2,7]

#Fix this so that it goes lowest to highest using your swap function
#Hint: you'll need an arguement for the first number and another arguement for the second number
#Have it print out the fixed array
