#That was some basic math and datatypes... lets get a bit trickier
#This is an array. it basically just contains a bunch of ints, floats, strings, or whatever you want

myArray = [7, 3.453, "stringyboi"]

#If I want a specific element from the array, you use square brackets as so

print(myArray[1])

#Hold on! Arrays are 0 indexed, meaning that the 1 element is number 0, element 2 is number 1, and so on
#This seems annoying, but you'll see this makes things easier later
#Now to finish, print the third element in myArray (which should say "stringyboi")

#Now what if I want to add something to an array? You use ARRAY.append(DATA)
#Add the number 47 to myArray and print it out
