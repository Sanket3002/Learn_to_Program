#Isn't this weird... this code won't print all of these words?

#print("Hi")
print("my")
print("name")
#print("is")
print("YOURNAME") #<--- put your name here

#Anything starting with a "#" is a comment and will be ignored when your computer runs it
#Notice you can use a # after a line of code too
#For this lesson, just uncomment the print lines and add your own comment somewhere that says "I can use comments!"
