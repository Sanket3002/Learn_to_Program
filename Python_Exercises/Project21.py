#Heres your first substantial project:

#Make a simple bubblesorting algorythm for an array that changes all the numbers to be in order
#Bubblesort means that it compares two values next to eachother and if one is more/less than the other, it swaps them. This is repeated until the entire list is sorted
#Have the output print the sorted array

#Hint: you'll need to go back and get that swap function from earlier

sortThisArray = [6,2,4,8,9,1,3,5,7]
