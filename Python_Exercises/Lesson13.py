#So what did that just do? Lets break it down...


#This says your "defining" a function
#|	this is the name of your function
#|	|	this is the first arguement, which in this case is a number
#|	|	|	this is the second arguement (which is also a number). you can have as many arguements as you want
#|	|	|	|
def addition(number1, number2):
	print(number1 + number2)


#Here your calling the function so you can use it
#|	this is the first arguement, which sets number1 = 8
#|	|    this is the second arguement, which sets number2 = 29
#|	|    |
addition(8, 29)
