#Moving onto something a bit more riveting: data types. What if I want something that contains a word? or a number? or anything? Well Pythons got you covered...

intiger = 8 #this is an int (intiger) which is basically just a whole number
float = 2.23654 #this is a float (aka a number with a decimial)
string = 'word' #this is a word
boolean = true #this is either true or false (make sure they are lowercase!)

#now use print and print out the values for intiger, float, and string. Note: this time, we might not need quotes...
print()
print()
