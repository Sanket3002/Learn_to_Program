import Lesson28Helper as L28H

#The last kinda big idea concept... the import line
#What does it do? It simply allows you to access data in that file
#Watch

myGoodBoi = L28H.Dog("James", "black", "Chiuawa", 21, True)

print(myGoodBoi.whatAnimal())

#Note, this will allow you to access data from the file, but won't run that file
#If you have things outside of a function or class, it will basically be ignored when it's imported
#Heres where it gets a little annyoing

myRandomAnimal = L28H.Cat("Mr Meow wow", "Black with white spot", "idk do cats have a breed", 3, True)

#Who knows what functions class Cat has! It could have anything, but you can find out if you nano Lesson28Helper.py
#To finish this assingment just make myRandomAnimal do any function in its class
